Abstract of our paper:

Defect depth is an important indicator for magnetic flux leakage (MFL) detection and estimation, in which the quantization error for defect depth is closely related to the length and width errors, but this feature has not been introduced into deep learning (DL) based defect quantification algorithms. Therefore, the networkâ€™s performance has always been limited because the training logic is different from the theoretical explanation of the quantification process. Here in this work, to describe and integrate the above theory in a deep neural network, we propose a doubly fed cross-residual network (DfedResNet) suitable for MFL defect detection based on DL. DfedResNet is used to quantify defects in MFL data and can automatically extract deep features of defects and is proven to be able to effectively achieve high-precision quantification of defect length, width, and depth simultaneously, especially the defect depth. Moreover, data from all three dimensions are effectively used for network training, and the originally measured magnetic signal data are used in place of recognized images to avoid the loss of defect information and further improve the quantification accuracy. The results show that the deep DfedResNet model proposed in this paper exhibits high quantitative performance compared with other network structures and traditional algorithms.
